<h1>www-prototype</h1>
<h2>An HTML shell of WWW for prototyping.</h2>

<p>This is a shell for prototyping the WWW site. If you need to test out a content block, UI element, or anything else, this has a fake drop down nav that mimics the production site.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
index.html is wired with the TST javascript (just create a div with an id of tst-widget) and jQuery UI. There's also a sass directory that processes to the main.css file in the CSS directory.</p>
